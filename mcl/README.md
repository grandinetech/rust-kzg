# KZG10 (Kate) Polynomial Commitments

## About

This is a KZG10 implmentation in Rust, heavily based on the Go implementation by protolambda https://github.com/protolambda/go-kzg.

This repo also contains Herumi MCL, as I could not find a way to make the cargo crate for mcl_rust work, and it does seem abandoned. It can be found here: https://github.com/herumi/mcl-rust.

## How to test/run

First follow the steps in Herumi mcl (refer to the link above), then just run the following code in checked out dir:
To test without rayon:

```bash
cargo test -- --test-threads 1 --nocapture
```

With rayon:
```bash
cargo test --features mcl_rust/parallel -- --test-threads 1 --nocapture
```

To run benchmarks, just run

```bash
cargo bench
```
